            <strong> Lion : </strong>
            The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera native to Africa and India. It has a muscular,
            broad-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually
            dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane. It is a social species,
            forming
            groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs. Groups of
            female
            lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator;
            although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, the species
            typically
            does not actively seek out and prey on humans.

            The lion inhabits grasslands, savannas and shrublands. It is usually more diurnal than other wild cats, but
            when
            persecuted, it adapts to being active at night and at twilight. During the Neolithic period, the lion ranged
            throughout Africa, Southeast Europe, the Caucasus, Western Asia and northern parts of India, but it has been
            reduced to fragmented populations in sub-Saharan Africa and one population in western India. It has been
            listed
            as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1996 because populations in African countries have declined by
            about
            43% since the early 1990s. Lion populations are untenable outside designated protected areas. Although the
            cause
            of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes for
            concern.

            One of the most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture, the lion has been extensively depicted in
            sculptures and paintings, on national flags, and in contemporary films and literature. Lions have been kept
            in
            menageries since the time of the Roman Empire and have been a key species sought for exhibition in
            zoological
            gardens across the world since the late 18th century. Cultural depictions of lions were prominent in Ancient
            Egypt, and depictions have occurred in virtually all ancient and medieval cultures in the lion's historic
            and
            current range.

            <strong> Elephant : </strong>
            Elephants are the largest existing land animals. Three living species are currently recognised: the African
            bush elephant, the African forest elephant, and the Asian elephant. They are an informal grouping within the
            subfamily Elephantinae of the order Proboscidea; extinct members include the mastodons. Elephantinae also
            contains several extinct groups, including the mammoths and straight-tusked elephants. African elephants
            have larger ears and concave backs, whereas Asian elephants have smaller ears, and convex or level backs.
            The distinctive features of all elephants include a long proboscis called a trunk, tusks, large ear flaps,
            massive legs, and tough but sensitive skin. The trunk is used for breathing, bringing food and water to the
            mouth, and grasping objects. Tusks, which are derived from the incisor teeth, serve both as weapons and as
            tools for moving objects and digging. The large ear flaps assist in maintaining a constant body temperature
            as well as in communication. The pillar-like legs carry their great weight.

            Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia and are found in
            different habitats, including savannahs, forests, deserts, and marshes. They are herbivorous, and they stay
            near water when it is accessible. They are considered to be keystone species, due to their impact on their
            environments. Elephants have a fissionâ€“fusion society, in which multiple family groups come together to
            socialise. Females (cows) tend to live in family groups, which can consist of one female with her calves or
            several related females with offspring. The groups, which do not include bulls, are usually led by the
            oldest cow, known as the matriarch.

            Males (bulls) leave their family groups when they reach puberty and may live alone or with other males.
            Adult bulls mostly interact with family groups when looking for a mate. They enter a state of increased
            testosterone and aggression known as musth, which helps them gain dominance over other males as well as
            reproductive success. Calves are the centre of attention in their family groups and rely on their mothers
            for as long as three years. Elephants can live up to 70 years in the wild. They communicate by touch, sight,
            smell, and sound; elephants use infrasound, and seismic communication over long distances. Elephant
            intelligence has been compared with that of primates and cetaceans. They appear to have self-awareness, and
            appear to show empathy for dying and dead family members.

            African bush elephants and Asian elephants are listed as endangered and African forest elephants as
            critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). One of the biggest
            threats to elephant populations is the ivory trade, as the animals are poached for their ivory tusks. Other
            threats to wild elephants include habitat destruction and conflicts with local people. Elephants are used as
            working animals in Asia. In the past, they were used in war; today, they are often controversially put on
            display in zoos, or exploited for entertainment in circuses. Elephants are highly recognisable and have been
            featured in art, folklore, religion, literature, and popular culture.

                <strong> Cow : </strong>
                "Cow" and "Cows" redirect here. For other uses, see Cattle (disambiguation) and Cow (disambiguation).
                Cattle (Bos taurus) are large domesticated bovines. They are most widespread species of the genus Bos.
                Adult females are referred to as cows and adult males are referred to as bulls.

                Cattle are commonly raised as livestock for meat (beef or veal, see beef cattle), for milk (see dairy
                cattle), and for hides, which are used to make leather. They are used as riding animals and draft
                animals (oxen or bullocks, which pull carts, plows and other implements). Another product of cattle is
                their dung, which can be used to create manure or fuel. In some regions, such as parts of India, cattle
                have significant religious significance. Cattle, mostly small breeds such as the Miniature Zebu, are
                also kept as pets.

                Different types of cattle are common to different geographic areas. Taurine cattle are found primarily
                in Europe and temperate areas of Asia, the Americas, and Australia. Zebus (also called indicine cattle)
                are found primarily in India and tropical areas of Asia, America, and Australia. Sanga cattle are found
                primarily in sub-Saharan Africa. These types (which are sometimes classified as separate species or
                subspecies) are further divided into over 1000 recognized breeds.

                Around 10,500 years ago, taurine cattle were domesticated from as few as 80 wild aurochs progenitors in
                central Anatolia, the Levant and Western Iran.[1] A separate domestication event occurred in the Indian
                subcontinent, which gave rise to zebu. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), there
                are approximately 1.5 billion cattle in the world as of 2018.[2] Cattle are the main source of
                greenhouse gas emissions from livestock, and are responsible for around 10% of global greenhouse gas
                emissions.[3][4] In 2009, cattle became one of the first livestock animals to have a fully mapped
                genome.[5]
