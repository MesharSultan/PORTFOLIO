            <strong> Areca Palm : </strong>
            The Areca Palm, or Dypsis lutescens (formerly Chrysalidocarpus lutescens), is a great palm for a tropical
            splash in the summertime on home patios and building entrances in northern climates. It can also thrive
            indoors, but it takes a lot of light for that to happen, and it’s highly rated for cleaning indoor air. Also
            known as the Butterfly Palm, because of its arching yellowish-green fronds, and the Party Palm, because it’s
            widely rented for weddings and parties, this less-expensive cousin of the Kentia Palm is a great choice for
            a long-term relationship if you can give it great light and keep it warm; otherwise, it’s a cheap date you
            can flirt with all summer and try another one next year.

            <strong> Flowering plant : </strong>
            Flowering plants are plants that bear flowers and fruits, and form the clade Angiospermae
            (/ˌændʒiəˈspɜːrmiː/),[5][6] commonly called angiosperms. The term "angiosperm" is derived from the Greek
            words angeion ('container, vessel') and sperma ('seed'), and refers to those plants that produce their seeds
            enclosed within a fruit. They are by far the most diverse group of land plants with 64 orders, 416 families,
            approximately 13,000 known genera and 300,000 known species.[7] Angiosperms were formerly called
            Magnoliophyta (/mæɡˌnoʊliˈɒfətə, -əˈfaɪtə/).[8]

            Like gymnosperms, angiosperms are seed-producing plants. They are distinguished from gymnosperms by
            characteristics including flowers, endosperm within their seeds, and the production of fruits that contain
            the seeds.

            The ancestors of flowering plants diverged from the common ancestor of all living gymnosperms during the
            Carboniferous, over 300 million years ago.[9] The closest fossil relatives of flowering plants are uncertain
            and contentious. The earliest record of angiosperm pollen appears around 134 million years ago during the
            Early Cretaceous. Over the course of the Cretaceous, angiosperms explosively diversified, becoming the
            dominant group of plants across the planet by the end of the period, corresponding with the decline and
            extinction of previously widespread gymnosperm groups.

            <h3>

        
            <strong> Thistle : </strong>
            Thistle is the common name of a group of flowering plants characterised by leaves with sharp prickles on the
            margins, mostly in the family Asteraceae. Prickles can also occur all over the plant – on the stem and on
            the flat parts of the leaves. These prickles are an adaptation that protects the plant from being eaten by
            herbivores. Typically, an involucre with a clasping shape similar to a cup or urn subtends each of a
            thistle's flower heads.

            The comparative amount of spininess varies dramatically by species. For example, Cirsium heterophyllum has
            minimal spininess while Cirsium spinosissimum is the opposite.[1] Typically, species adapted to dry
            environments have greater spininess.

            The term thistle is sometimes taken to mean precisely those plants in the tribe Cardueae (synonym:
            Cynareae),[2] especially the genera Carduus, Cirsium, and Onopordum.[3] However, plants outside this tribe
            are sometimes called thistles.

            Biennial thistles are particularly noteworthy for their high wildlife value, producing such things as
            copious floral resources for pollinators, nourishing seeds for birds like the goldfinch, foliage for
            butterfly larvae, and down for the lining of birds' nests.[4][5][6]

            A thistle is the floral emblem of Scotland and Lorraine, as well as the emblem of the Encyclopædia
            Britannica.
