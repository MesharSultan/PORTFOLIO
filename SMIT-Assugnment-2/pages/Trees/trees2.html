            <strong> Oak : </strong>
            An oak is a tree or shrub in the genus Quercus (/ˈkwɜːrkəs/;[1] Latin "oak tree") of the beech family,
            Fagaceae. There are approximately 500 extant species of oaks.[2] The common name "oak" also appears in the
            names of species in related genera, notably Lithocarpus (stone oaks), as well as in those of unrelated
            species such as Grevillea robusta (silky oaks) and the Casuarinaceae (she-oaks). The genus Quercus is native
            to the Northern Hemisphere, and includes deciduous and evergreen species extending from cool temperate to
            tropical latitudes in the Americas, Asia, Europe, and North Africa. North America has the largest number of
            oak species, with approximately 160 species in Mexico of which 109 are endemic and about 90 in the United
            States. The second greatest area of oak diversity is China, with approximately 100 species.[3]

            <strong> Neem : </strong>
            Azadirachta indica, commonly known as neem, nimtree or Indian lilac,[3] is a tree in the mahogany family
            Meliaceae. It is one of two species in the genus Azadirachta, and is native to the Indian subcontinent and
            most of the countries in Africa. It is typically grown in tropical and semi-tropical regions. Neem trees
            also grow on islands in southern Iran. Its fruits and seeds are the source of neem oil.

            <strong> polyalthia tree : </strong>
            Monoon longifolium, the false ashoka, also commonly known by its synonym Polyalthia longifolia, is an Asian
            small tree species in the family Annonaceae. It is native to southern India and Sri Lanka, but has been
            widely introduced elsewhere in tropical Asia.[1] This evergreen tree is known to grow over 20 m. in height
            and is commonly planted due to its effectiveness in alleviating noise pollution. It exhibits symmetrical
            pyramidal growth with willowy weeping pendulous branches and long narrow lanceolate leaves with undulate
            margins.

            Monoon longifolium is sometimes incorrectly identified as the ashoka tree (Saraca indica) because of the
            close resemblance of both trees. It can appear to have no branches, but in fact a M. longifolium allowed to
            grow naturally (without trimming the branches out for decorative reasons) grows into a normal large tree
            giving plenty of shade.
